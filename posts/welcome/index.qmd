I created a function to convert a column of list to a whole row of columns.
The only problem with this is that every list is almost a different size. 
Which would create problems. What I was use rbind.fill to append the rows on top of each other and fill the empty columns with NAs. 

The code is show below 

```python
convert_dataframe_col <- function(data_to_concat, data){
  # This is to create the number of times I had to run the for loop below
  range <- 1:nrow(data)
  
  # This is to create a new dataFrame to append the rows to
  new_ft <- data.frame()
  
  # This for loop converts the list into columns (which sometimes it gives two, then I select the first one) and then transpose it to a row which I then rbind it to the dataFrame I created above
  for (val in range){
    temp_frame <- head(data.frame(t(do.call(data.frame, data_to_concat[val]))), 1)
    new_ft <- rbind.fill(new_ft, temp_frame)
  }
  
  # This is to bind the newly created dataset to the original dataset
  new_ft <- cbind(data, new_ft)
  return(new_ft)
}

```
