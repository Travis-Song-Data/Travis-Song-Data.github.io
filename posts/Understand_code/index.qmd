The code I am trying to understand is really difficult. I had to take about 3 weeks with Logan helping me to understand his code.

Now that I understand it. I will explain it to you here.

The code first download all of the farm field coordinates which is called chunk_id. The picture below will show you the chunk_ids

Then it reads in a dataset that has dates, latitude, longitude, and more that we got from stotz. 

Then we will also download the metadata about the HRRR grid

We will then use the field lat, long, and nc_data to download the respective temperature of the date

After getting all of the temperature we will filter it to the date range of that crop

This is to the extent of my knowledge
